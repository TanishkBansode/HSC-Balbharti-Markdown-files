### Can you recall ?
*   What is the influence of particle size of reacting solid on rate of a chemical reaction?
*   Why is finely divided nickel used in hydrogenation of oil ?
*   What is effect of change of temperature on the rate of a chemical reaction?

***

Average rate = change in concentration of a species / change in time 
= Δc / Δt

Consider the reaction A → B in which A is consumed and B is produced.

average rate of consumption of A = - Δ[A] / Δt

Average rate of formation of B = + Δ[B] / Δt

Therefore, average rate of reaction = - Δ[A] / Δt = + Δ[B] / Δt

The rate of reaction represents a decrease in concentration of the reactant per unit time or increase in concentration of product per unit time. The dimensions of rate are concentration divided by time, that is, mol dm⁻³ sec⁻¹.

#### 6.1 Introduction
Three important characteristics of chemical reactions include : extent of reaction, feasibility and its rate. In standard XI, we learnt how equibrium constants predict the extent of reaction. In unit 3 of this textbook, we learnt how thermodynamic properties such as change in entropy or enthalpy tell us whether under the given set of conditions the chemical reaction represented by a chemical equation occurs or not. Chemical kinetics is a branch of chemistry which deals with the rate of chemical reactions and the factors those affect them.

A chemist wants to know the rates of reactions for different reasons. Firstly the study of reaction rates help us to predict how rapidly the reaction approaches equilibrium. Secondly it gives information on the mechanism of chemical reactions.

A number of reactions occur as a sequence of elementary steps constituting the mechanism of reaction.

#### 6.2 Rate of reactions
The rate of reaction describes how rapidly the reactants are consumed or the products are formed.

##### 6.2.1 Average rate of chemical reaction
The average rate of a reaction can be described by knowing change in concentration of reactant or product divided by time interval over which the change occurs. Thus,

##### 6.2.2 Instantaneous rate of
To determine the instantaneous rate of a reaction the progress of a reaction is followed by measuring the concentrations of reactant or product for different time intervals. The changes in concentration are relatively fast in the

beginning which later become slow. The concentration of a reactant or a product plotted against time are shown in Fig. 6.1 (a) and 6.1 (b). A tangent drawn to the curve at time t₁ gives the rate of the reaction. The slope thus obtained gives the instantaneous rate of the reaction at time t₁. The instantaneous rate dc/dt, is represented by replacing Δc/Δt by derivative dc/dt in the expression of average rate. In chemical kinetics we are concerned with instantaneous rates.

For the reaction, A → B,

Rate of consumption of A at any time t = - d[A]/dt

Rate of formation of B at any time t = d[B]/dt

Rate of reaction at time t = - d[A]/dt = d[B]/dt

For the reaction involving one mole of A and B each, the rate of consumption of A equals the rate of formation of B. This is not true for the reactions involving different stoichiometries. Consider, for example, a reaction :

A + 3B → 2C

When one mole of A and three moles of B are consumed, two moles of C are formed. The stoichiometric coefficients of the three species are different. Thus the rate of consumption of B is three times the rate of consumption of A. Likewise the rate of formation of C is twice the rate of consumption of A. We write,

d[B]/dt = -3 d[A]/dt and d[C]/dt = -2 d[A]/dt

With this

-d[A]/dt = -1/3 d[B]/dt = 1/2 d[C]/dt

or rate of reaction = - d[A]/dt = -1/3 d[B]/dt = 1/2 d[C]/dt

In general, For aA + bB → cC + dD,

rate = -1/a d[A]/dt = -1/b d[B]/dt = 1/c d[C]/dt = 1/d d[D]/dt

**Problem 6.1:** For the reaction 2 N₂O₅(g) → 4 NO₂(g) + O₂(g) in liquid bromine, N₂O₅ disappears at a rate of 0.02 moles dm⁻³ sec⁻¹. At what rate NO₂ and O₂ are formed? What would be the rate of reaction?

**Solution :**
Given : -d[N₂O₅]/dt = 0.02

**i. Rate of reaction**
= -1/2 d[N₂O₅]/dt = 1/4 d[NO₂]/dt = d[O₂]/dt
= 1/2 (-d[N₂O₅]/dt) = 1/2 × 0.02
= 0.01 mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹

**ii. Rate of formation of O₂ = d[O₂]/dt**
= 1/2 (-d[N₂O₅]/dt) = 1/2 × 0.02 mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹
= 0.01 mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹

**iii. Rate of formation of NO₂ = d[NO₂]/dt**
= 4/2 (-d[N₂O₅]/dt)
= 2 × 0.02 mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹
= 0.04 mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹

### 6.3 Rate of reaction and reactant concentration
The rate of a reaction at a given temperature for a given time instant depends on the concentration of reactant. Such rate-concentration relation is the rate law.

#### 6.3.1 Rate law
Consider the general reaction,
aA + bB → cC + dD .................... (6.1)

The rate of reaction at a given time is proportional to molar concentration of reactants at that time raised to simple powers or

Rate of reaction ∝ [A]ˣ[B]ʸ or
rate = k [A]ˣ[B]ʸ .................... (6.2)

where k the proportionality constant is called the rate constant, which is independent of concentration and varies with temperature. For unit concentrations of A and B, k is equal to the rate of reaction. Equation (6.2) is called *differential rate law*.

The powers x and y of the concentration terms A and B in the rate law are not necessarily equal to stoichiometric coefficients (a and b) appearing in Eq. (6.1). Thus x and y may be simple whole numbers, zero or fraction. you have to realize that x and y are experimentally determined. The rate law in Eq. (6.2) is determined experimentally and expresses the rate of a chemical reaction in terms of molar concentrations of the reactants and not predicted from the stoichiometries of the reactants.

The exponents x and y appearing in the rate law tell us how the concentration change affects the rate of the reaction.
(i) For x = y = 1, Eq. (6.2) gives
rate = k[A][B]
The equation implies that the rate of the reaction depends linearly on concentrations of A and B. If either of concentration of A or B is doubled, the rate would be doubled.
(ii) For x = 2 and y = 1. The Eq. (6.2) then leads to rate = k[A]²[B]. If concentration of A is doubled keeping that of B constant, the rate of reaction will increase by a factor of 4.
(iii) If x=0, the rate is independent of concentration of A.
(iv) If x < 0 the rate decreases as [A] increases.

#### 6.3.2 Writing the rate law
Consider the reaction,
2H₂O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(l) + O₂(g).
If the rate of the reaction is proportional to concentration of H₂O₂. The rate law is given by
rate = k[H₂O₂]

***

**Try this...**
For the reaction,
NO₂(g) + CO(g) → NO(g) + CO₂(g),
the rate of reaction is experimentally found to be proportional to the square of the concentration of NO₂ and independent that of CO. Write the rate law.

***

**Problem 6.2:** Write the rate law for the reaction, A + B → P from the following data:

| | [A] mol dm⁻³ | [B] mol dm⁻³ | Initial rate mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| | (Initial) | (Initial) | |
| (i) | 0.4 | 0.2 | 4.0 × 10⁻⁵ |
| (ii) | 0.6 | 0.2 | 6.0 × 10⁻⁵ |
| (iii) | 0.8 | 0.4 | 3.2 × 10⁻⁴ |

**Solution :** Rate = k [A]ˣ[B]ʸ
a. From above data (i) and (ii), when [A] increases by a factor 1.5 keeping [B] as constant, the rate increases by a factor 1.5. It means rate ∝ [A] and x = 1
b. From observations (i) and (iii), it can be seen that when concentrations of A and B are doubled, the rate increases by a factor 8. Due to doubling of [A] the rate is doubled (because x = 1) that is rate increases by a factor 2.
This implies that doubling [B], the rate increases by a factor 4. or rate ∝ [B]² and y = 2. Therefore, rate = k[A] [B]²
contd....

***

**Problem 6.2 contd....**
**Alternatively**
The rate law gives rate = k [A]ˣ[B]ʸ.
a. From above observations (i) and (ii)
(i) 4 × 10⁻⁵ = k(0.4)ˣ(0.2)ʸ
(ii) 6 × 10⁻⁵ = k(0.6)ˣ(0.2)ʸ
Dividing (ii) by (i), we have
(6 × 10⁻⁵) / (4 × 10⁻⁵) = (k(0.6)ˣ(0.2)ʸ) / (k(0.4)ˣ(0.2)ʸ)
1.5 = (0.6/0.4)ˣ
= (1.5)ˣ
Hence x = 1
b. From observations (i) and (iii) separately in the rate law gives
iii) 4 × 10⁻⁵ = k(0.4) × (0.2)ʸ since x = 1
iv) 3.2 × 10⁻⁴ = k(0.8) × (0.4)ʸ
Dividing (iv) by (iii) we write
(3.2 × 10⁻⁴) / (4 × 10⁻⁵) = (k(0.8)(0.4)ʸ) / (k(0.4)(0.2)ʸ)
or 8 = 2 × (0.4/0.2)ʸ
or 4 = 2ʸ = 2²
Therefore y = 2.
The rate law is then rate = k[A][B]².

***

**Problem 6.3:** For the reaction,
2 NOBr(g) → 2 NO(g) + Br₂(g),
the rate law is rate = k[NOBr]². If the rate of the reaction is 6.5 × 10⁻⁶ mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹ when the concentration of NOBr is 2 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹. What would be the rate constant for the reaction?
**Solution :**
rate = k[NOBr]² or k = rate / [NOBr]²
= (6.5 × 10⁻⁶ mol L⁻¹s⁻¹) / (2 × 10⁻³mol L⁻¹)²
= 1.625 mol⁻¹ L s⁻¹

***

**Try this...**
*   For the reaction
    2A + 2B → 2C +D, if concentration of A is doubled at constant [B] the rate increases by a factor of 4. If the concentration of B is doubled with [A] being constant the rate is doubled. Write the rate law of the reaction.
*   The rate law for the reaction
    A + B → C is found to be
    rate = k[A]²[B].
    The rate constant of the reaction at 25 °C is 6.25 M⁻²s⁻¹. What is the rate of reaction when [A] = 1.0 mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹ and [B] = 0.2 mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹?

***

#### 6.3.3 Order of the reaction
For the reaction,
aA + bB → cC + dD is
If the rate of the reaction is given as
rate = k[A]ˣ[B]ʸ.
Then the sum x + y gives overall order of the reaction. Thus overall order of the chemical reaction is given as the sum of powers of the concentration terms in the rate law expression. For example :
i. For the reaction,
2H₂O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l) + O₂(g)
experimentally determined rate law is
rate = k[H₂O₂].
The reaction is of first order.
ii. If the experimentally determined rate law for the reaction
H₂(g) + I₂(g) → 2 HI(g) is
rate = k[H₂][I₂].
The reaction is of first order in H₂ and I₂ each and hence overall of second order.

***

**Key points about the order of reaction**
a. The order of chemical reaction is experimentally determined.
b. The order can be integer or fractional.
Look at the reaction,
CH₃CHO(g) → CH₄(g) + CO(g).
The rate law for the reaction was found to be
rate = k[CH₃CHO]³/².
Here the order of the reaction is 3/2.
c. The order of the reaction, can be zero for :
NO₂(g) + CO(g) → NO(g) + CO₂(g)
The rate expression for this is : rate = k[NO₂]².
This shows that order of reaction with respect to NO₂ is 2 and with CO is zero or the rate is independent of concentration of CO. The overall order of reaction is 2.
d. Only a few reactions of third order are known. Reactions with the orders higher than three are rare.

***

**Problem 6.4:** For the reaction
2NO(g) + 2H₂(g) → N₂(g) + 2 H₂O(g),
the rate law is rate = k[NO]² [H₂]. What is the order with respect to NO and H₂? What is the overall order of the reaction ?
**Solution :** In the rate law expression, the exponent of [NO] is 2 and that of [H₂] is 1. Hence, reaction is second order in NO, first order in H₂, and the reaction is third order.

***

**Try this...**
The reaction, CHCl₃(g) + Cl₂(g) → CCl₄(g) + HCl(g) is first order in CHCl₃ and 1/2 order in Cl₂.
Write the rate law and overall order of reaction.

***

**Problem 6.5:** The rate of the reaction,
A + B → P is 3.6 × 10⁻² mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹ when [A] = 0.2 mol dm⁻³ and [B] = 0.1 mol dm⁻³. Calculate the rate constant if the reaction is first order in A and second order in B.

**Solution :** The reaction is first order in A and second order in B. Hence, the rate law gives
rate = k[A][B]²
or k = rate / ([A][B]²)
rate = 3.6 × 10⁻² mol dm⁻³s⁻¹,
[A] = 0.2 mol dm⁻³ and [B] = 0.1 mol dm⁻³
Substitution gives
k = (3.6 × 10⁻² mol dm⁻³s⁻¹) / (0.2 mol dm⁻³ × (0.1 mol dm⁻³)²)
= (3.6 × 10⁻² s⁻¹) / (0.2 × 0.01 mol² dm⁻⁶)
= 18 mol⁻² dm⁶ s⁻¹

***

**Use your brain power**
The rate of the reaction 2A + B → 2C + D is 6 × 10⁻⁴ mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹ when [A] = [B] = 0.3 mol dm⁻³. If the reaction is of first order in A and zeroth order in B, what is the rate constant?

***

**Problem 6.6:** Consider, A + B → P. If the concentration of A is doubled with [B] being constant, the rate of the reaction doubles. If the concentration of A is tripled and that of B is doubled, the rate increases by a factor 6. What is order of the reaction with respect to each reactant ? Determine the overall order of the reaction.
**Solution :**
Rate of reaction : rate = k[A]ˣ[B]ʸ ..... (i)
If [A] is doubled, the rate doubles.
∴ 2×rate = k [2A]ˣ[B]ʸ = k 2ˣ [A]ˣ[B]ʸ ...... (ii)
6 × rate = k [3A]ˣ[2B]ʸ ..................... (iii)
(ii)/(i) gives (2 × rate)/rate = (k 2ˣ [A]ˣ[B]ʸ) / (k [A]ˣ[B]ʸ)
(iii)/(i) gives (6 × rate)/rate = (k 3ˣ[A]ˣ[2B]ʸ) / (k [A]ˣ[B]ʸ) = 3ˣ × 2ʸ
substitute x = 1
∴ 6 = 3 × 2ʸ or 2 = 2ʸ and y = 1
The reaction is first order in A and first order in B. The overall reaction is of the second order.

### 6.4 Molecularity of elementary reactions
Complex reactions are those which constitute a series of elementary reactions.

#### 6.4.1 Elementary reaction
Consider,
O₃(g) → O₂(g) + O(g)
C₂H₅I(g) → C₂H₄(g) + HI(g)
These reactions occur in a single step and cannot be broken down further into simpler reactions. These are elementary reactions.

#### 6.4.2 Molecularity of reaction
The molecularity refers to how many reactant molecules are involved in reactions. In the above reactions there is only one reactant molecule. These are unimolecular reactions or their molecularity is one.
O₃(g) + O(g) → 2 O₂(g)
2 NO₂(g) → 2 NO(g) + O₂(g)
The elementary reactions involving two reactant molecules are bimolecular reactions or they have molecularity as two.
The molecularity of an elementary reaction is the number of reactant molecules taking part in it.

#### 6.4.3 Order and molecularity of elementary reactions
The rate law for the elementary reaction 2NO₂(g) → 2NO(g) + O₂(g) is found to be rate = k[NO₂]². The reaction is second order and bimolecular. The order of reaction is 2 and its molecularity is also 2.
For the elementary reaction,
C₂H₅ I(g) → C₂H₄(g) + HI(g)
rate = k[C₂H₅I]
It is unimolecular and first order. However the order and molecularity of the reaction may or may not be the same.

#### 6.4.4 Rate determining step
A number of chemical reactions are complex. They take place as a series of elementary steps. One of these steps is slower than others. The slowest step is the rate determining step.
The slowest step determines the rate of overall reaction.
Consider, 2NO₂Cl(g) → 2NO₂(g) + Cl₂(g).
The reaction takes place in two steps:
i. NO₂Cl(g) --k₁--> NO₂(g) + Cl(g) (slow)
ii. NO₂Cl(g) + Cl (g) --k₂--> NO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) (fast)
Overall 2NO₂Cl(g) → 2NO₂(g) + Cl₂(g)
The first step being slower than the second it is the rate determining step.
The rate law is
rate = k[NO₂Cl]
This also represents the rate law of the overall reaction. The reaction thus is of the first order.

**Reaction intermediate:**
In the above reaction Cl is formed in the first step and consumed in the second. Such species represents the reaction intermediate. The concentration of reaction intermediate does not appear in the rate law.

**Distinction between order and molecularity of a reaction :**

| Order | Molecularity |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. It is experimentally determined property. | i. It is theoretical entity. |
| 2. It is the sum of powers of the concentration terms of reactants those appear in the rate equation. | ii. It is the number of reactant molecules taking part in an elementary reaction. |
| 3. It may be an integer, fraction or zero. | iii. It is integer. |

***

**Problem 6.7 :** A reaction occurs in the following steps
i. NO₂(g) + F₂(g) → NO₂F(g) + F(g) (slow)
ii. F(g) + NO₂(g) → NO₂F(g) (fast)
a. Write the equation of overall reaction.
b. Write down rate law.
c. Identify the reaction intermediate.

**Solution :**
a. The addition of two steps gives the overall reaction as
2NO₂(g) + F₂(g) → 2 NO₂F(g)
b. Step (i) is slow. The rate law of the reaction is predicted from its stoichiometry. Thus,
rate = k[NO₂] [F₂]
c. F is produced in step (i) and consumed in step (ii) or F is the reaction intermediate.

A complex reaction takes place in two steps:
i) NO(g) + O₃(g) → NO₂(g) + O(g)
ii) NO₂(g) + O(g) → NO₂(g) + O₂(g)

### 6.5 Integrated rate law
We introduced the differential rate law earlier. It describes how rate of a reaction depends on the concentration of reactants in terms of derivatives.
The differential rate laws are converted into integrated rate laws. These tell us the concentrations of reactants for different times.

#### 6.5.1 Integrated rate law for the first order reactions in solution
Consider first order reaction,
A → product .................... (6.3)
The differential rate law is given by
rate = -d[A]/dt = k [A] .................... (6.4)
where [A] is the concentration of reactant at time t.
Rearranging Eq. (6.4),
d[A]/[A] = -k dt .................... (6.5)
Let [A]₀ be the initial concentration of the reactant A at time t = 0. Suppose [A]ₜ is the concentration of A at time = t.
The equation (6.5) is integrated between limits [A] = [A]₀ at t = 0 and [A] = [A]ₜ at t = t
∫[A]ₜ_[A]₀ (d[A]/[A]) = ∫ᵗ₀ -k dt
On integration,
[ln[A]]^[A]ₜ_[A]₀ = -k [t]ᵗ₀
Substitution of limits gives
ln [A]ₜ - ln [A]₀ = -k t
or ln ([A]ₜ / [A]₀) = -kt .................... (6.6)
or k = (1/t) ln ([A]₀ / [A]ₜ)
Converting ln to log₁₀, we write
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀ ([A]₀ / [A]ₜ) .................... (6.7)
Eq. (6.7) gives the integrated rate law for the first order reactions.
The rate law can be written in the following forms
i. Eq. (6.6) is ln ([A]ₜ / [A]₀) = -kt
By taking antilog of both sides we get
[A]ₜ / [A]₀ = e⁻ᵏᵗ or [A]ₜ = [A]₀e⁻ᵏᵗ .................... (6.8)
ii. Let 'a' mol dm⁻³ be the initial concentration of A at t = 0
Let x mol dm⁻³ be the concentration of A that decreases (reacts) during time t. The

***

concentration of A that remains unreacted at time t would be (a - x) mol/dm³
Substitution of [A]₀ and [A]ₜ = (a - x)
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀ (a / (a-x)) .................... (6.9)
Equations (6.7), (6.8) and (6.9) represent the integrated rate law of first order reactions.

#### 6.5.2 Units of rate constant for the first order reaction
The integrated rate law is
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀ ([A]₀/[A]ₜ)
Because log₁₀ ([A]₀/[A]ₜ) is unitless quantity, the dimensions of k will be (time)⁻¹. The units of k will be s⁻¹, min⁻¹ or (hour)⁻¹

#### 6.5.3 Half life of the first order reactions (t₁/₂)
Radioactive processes follow the first order kinetics. The half life of reaction is time required for the reactant concentration to fall to one half of its initial value.

#### 6.5.4 Half life and rate constant of the first order reaction
The integrated rate law for the first order reaction is
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀ ([A]₀/[A]ₜ)
where [A]₀ is the initial concentration of reactant at t = 0. It falls to [A]ₜ at time t after the start of the reaction. The time required for [A]₀ to become [A]₀/2 is denoted as t₁/₂
or
[A]ₜ = [A]₀/2 at t = t₁/₂
Putting this condition in the integrated rate law we write
k = (2.303/t₁/₂) log₁₀ ([A]₀/([A]₀/2))
= (2.303/t₁/₂) log₁₀ 2
= (2.303/t₁/₂) × 0.3010
k = 0.693 / t₁/₂
t₁/₂ = 0.693 / k .................... (6.10)
Eq. (6.10) shows that half life of the first order reaction is independent of initial reactant concentration. This is shown in Fig (6.2) as a plot of [A]ₜ versus t.

***

**Fig. 6.2 : Half life period of first order reaction**

*   A graph with the y-axis labeled [A] and the x-axis labeled time. A curve starts high on the y-axis and decreases over time. The half-life is indicated by the time it takes for the concentration to drop to half its initial value.

***

#### 6.5.5 Graphical representation of the first order reactions
i. The differential rate law for the first order reaction A → P is
rate = -d[A]/dt = k [A] + 0
y = m x + c
The equation is of the form y = mx + c. A plot of rate versus concentration [A] is a straight line passing through origin. This is shown in Fig. 6.3. The slope of straight line = k.

***

**Fig. 6.3: Variation of rate with [A]**

*   A graph with the y-axis labeled "rate" and the x-axis labeled "initial Concentration". A straight line passes through the origin with a positive slope, showing that the rate is directly proportional to the concentration.

***

ii. From Eq. (6.7) the integrated rate law is
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀ ([A]₀/[A]ₜ)
On rearrangement, the equation becomes
kt/2.303 = log₁₀ [A]₀ - log₁₀ [A]ₜ
Hence, log₁₀ [A]ₜ = (-k/2.303) t + log₁₀ [A]₀
This corresponds to the equation of a straight line y = m x + c.
The equation is of the straight line. A graph of log₁₀ [A]ₜ versus t yields a straight line with slope -k/2.303 and y-axis intercept as log₁₀[A]₀. This is shown in Fig. 6.4

***

**Fig. 6.4 : A plot showing log₁₀ [A]ₜ vs time t**

*   A graph with the y-axis labeled log₁₀[A]ₜ and the x-axis labeled time t. A straight line is shown with a negative slope, intersecting the y-axis at a positive value (the intercept is log₁₀[A]₀).

***

iii. Eq. (6.7) gives
log₁₀ ([A]₀/[A]ₜ) = (k/2.303) t
This corresponds to the equation y = m x.
The equation has a straight line form y = mx.
Hence, the graph of log₁₀ ([A]₀/[A]ₜ) versus t is straight line passing through origin as shown in Fig. 6.5.

***

**Fig. 6.5 : A plot of log₁₀[A]₀/[A]ₜ vs time t**

*   A graph with the y-axis labeled log₁₀([A]₀/[A]ₜ) and the x-axis labeled t. A straight line passes through the origin with a positive slope (slope = k/2.303).

#### 6.5.6 Examples of first order reactions
Some examples of reactions of first order are :
i. 2 H₂O₂(l) → 2 H₂O(l) + O₂(g),
rate = k[H₂O₂]
ii. 2 N₂O₅(g) → 4 NO₂(g) + O₂(g),
rate = k [N₂O₅]

#### 6.5.7 Integrated rate law for gas phase reactions
For the gas phase reaction,
A(g) → B(g) + C(g)
Let initial pressure of A be Pᵢ that decreases by x within time t.
Pressure of reactant A at time t
Pₐ = Pᵢ - x .................... (6.11)
The pressures of the products B and C at time t are
Pₑ = Pₑ = x
The total pressure at time t is then
P = Pₐ + Pₑ + Pₑ = (Pᵢ - x) + x + x = Pᵢ + x
Hence, x = P - Pᵢ .................... (6.12)
Pressure of A, Pₐ at time t is obtained by substitution of Eq. (6.12) into Eq. (6.11). Thus
Pₐ = Pᵢ - (P - Pᵢ) = Pᵢ - P + Pᵢ = 2Pᵢ - P
The integrated rate law turns out to be
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀ ([A]₀/[A]ₜ)
The concentration now expressed in terms of pressures.
Thus, [A]₀ = Pᵢ and [A]ₜ = Pₐ = 2 Pᵢ - P
Substitution gives in above
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀ (Pᵢ / (2 Pᵢ - P)) .................... (6.13)
P is the total pressure of the reaction mixture at time t.

**Problem 6.8:** The half life of first order reaction is 990 s. If the initial concentration of the reactant is 0.08 mol dm⁻³, what concentration would remain after 35 minutes?
**Solution :**
k = 0.693 / t₁/₂ = 0.693 / 990 s = 7 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀([A]₀/[A]ₜ)
[A]₀ = 0.08 mol dm⁻³, t = 35 min or 2100 s, [A]ₜ = ?
log₁₀([A]₀/[A]ₜ) = kt / 2.303 = (7 × 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ × 2100 s) / 2.303 = 0.6383
[A]₀/[A]ₜ = antilog 0.6383 = 4.35
Hence, [A]ₜ = [A]₀ / 4.35 = 0.08 / 4.35 = 0.0184 mol dm⁻³

***

**Problem 6.9:** In a first order reaction 60% of the reactant decomposes in 45 minutes. Calculate the half life for the reaction
**Solution :**
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀ ([A]₀/[A]ₜ)
[A]₀ = 100, [A]ₜ = 100 - 60 = 40, t = 45 min
Substitution of these in above
k = (2.303/45) log₁₀ (100/40)
= (2.303/45) log₁₀ 2.5
= (2.303/45) × 0.3979 = 0.0204 min⁻¹
t₁/₂ = 0.693 / k = 0.693 / 0.0204 min⁻¹ = 34 min

***

**Try this...**
The half life of a first order reaction is 0.5 min. Calculate time needed for the reactant to reduce to 20% and the amount decomposed in 55 s.

***

**Problem 6.10:** Following data were obtained during the first order decomposition of SO₂Cl₂ at the constant volume.
SO₂Cl₂(g) → SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g)

| Time/s | Total pressure/bar |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 0.5 |
| 100 | 0.6 |

Calculate the rate constant of the reaction.
**Solution :**
k = (2.303/t) log₁₀(Pᵢ / (2Pᵢ - P))
Pᵢ = 0.5 bar, P = 0.6 bar, t = 100 s
k = (2.303/100) log₁₀(0.5 / (2 × 0.5 - 0.6))
= (2.303/100) log₁₀ (0.5 / 0.4) = 2.23 × 10⁻³ s⁻¹

#### 6.5.8 Zero order reactions
The rate of zero order reaction is independent of the reactant concentration.

**Integrated rate law for zero order reactions :**
For zero order reaction,
A → P
the differential rate law is given by
rate = -d[A]/dt = k [A]⁰ = k .....(6.14)
Rearrangement of Eq. (6.14) gives
d[A] = -k dt
Integration between the limits
[A] = [A]₀ at t = 0 and [A] = [A]ₜ at t = t gives
∫[A]ₜ_[A]₀ d[A] = ∫ᵗ₀ -k dt
or [A]ₜ - [A]₀ = - kt
Hence, kt = [A]₀ - [A]ₜ .................... (6.15)
Units of rate constant of zero order reactions
k = ([A]₀ - [A]ₜ) / t = (mol L⁻¹) / t = mol dm⁻³ t⁻¹
The units of rate constant of zero order reaction are the same as the rate.

***

**Half life of zero order reactions:** The rate constant of zero order reaction is given by eqn (6.15)
k = ([A]₀ - [A]ₜ) / t
Using the conditions t = t₁/₂, [A]ₜ = [A]₀/2,
Eq. (6.15) becomes
k = ([A]₀ - [A]₀/2) / t₁/₂ = [A]₀ / (2 t₁/₂)
Hence, t₁/₂ = [A]₀ / 2k .................... 6.16
The half life of zero order reactions is proportional to the initial concentration of reactant.

**Graphical representation of zero order reactions :** The rate law in Eq. (6.15) gives
[A]ₜ = -k t + [A]₀ .................... 6.17
y = m x + c
Which is straight line given by y = mx + c.
A plot of [A]ₜ versus t is a straight line as shown in Fig 6.6.

***

**Fig. 6.6: [A]t vs t for zero order reaction**

*   A graph with the y-axis labeled [A]ₜ and the x-axis labeled time. A straight line with a negative slope is shown. The y-intercept is [A]₀.

***

The slope of straight line is -k and its intercept on y-axis is [A]₀.
The t₁/₂ of zero order reaction is directly proportional to the initial concentration.

**Examples of zero order reactions :**
Here follow some examples
**Decomposition of NH₃ on platinum metal**
2 NH₃(g) → N₂(g) + 3 H₂(g)
The metals surface gets completely covered by a layer of NH₃ molecules. A number of NH₃ molecules attached on platinum surface is small compared to total ammonia. A large number of the NH₃ molecules tend to remain as gas which do not react. The molecules present on the metal surface only react. The rate of a reaction is thus independent of the total concentration of NH₃ and remains constant.
ii. Decomposition of nitrous oxide in the presence of Pt catalyst.
2 N₂O(g) --Pt--> 2 N₂(g) + O₂(g)
iii. The catalytic decomposition of PH₃ on hot tungsten at high pressure.

#### 6.5.9 Pseudo-first order reactions
Certain reactions which are expected to be of higher order follow the first order kinetics. Consider hydrolysis of methyl acetate.
CH₃COOCH₃(aq) + H₂O(l) → CH₃COOH(aq) + CH₃OH(aq)
The rate law is
rate = k' [CH₃COOCH₃] [H₂O]
The reaction is expected to follow the second order kinetics, however, obeys the first order.
The reason is that solvent water is present in such large excess that the change in its concentration is negligible compared to initial one or its concentration remains constant.
Thus [H₂O] = constant = k". The rate law becomes
rate = k' [CH₃COOCH₃] k"
= k [CH₃COO CH₃]
where k = k'k"
The reaction is thus of first order.

***

The reaction C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁(aq) + H₂O (l) (excess) → C₆H₁₂O₆(aq) + C₆H₁₂O₆(aq) (glucose + fructose)
Can it be of pseudo-first order type ?

### 6.6 Collision theory of bimolecular reactions

#### 6.6.1 Collision between reactant molecules
Chemical reactions occur as a result of collisions between the reactant species. It may be expected that the rate of the reaction is equal to the rate of collision. For the gas-phase reactions the number of collisions is far more and typically many powers of tens compared to the observed rate.

#### 6.6.2 Activation
For the reaction to occur the colliding reactant molecules must possess the minimum kinetic energy. This minimum kinetic energy is the activation energy. The reaction would occur only if colliding molecules possess kinetic energies equal to or greater than the activation energy.

#### 6.6.3 Orientation of reactant molecules
The requirement for successful collision described above is sufficient for reactions involving simple molecules (or ions) however not for those involving complex molecules.
Besides the above considerations the colliding molecules must have proper orientation. The molecules need to be so oriented relative to each other that the reacting groups approach closely.
Consider, A + C - B → A - B + C
i. The collision of A with C approaching toward A would not lead to reaction.
[Image shows molecule A approaching molecule C-B from the C side. After collision, they separate without reaction.]
No reaction will takes place. The reactant molecules would collide and separate owing to the improper orientation of C - B.
ii.
[Image shows molecule A approaching molecule C-B from the B side. This leads to the formation of A-B and C.]
The reaction is successful as a result of proper orientation of C - B. A fraction of such collisions bring forth conversion of reactants to products.

#### 6.6.4 Potential energy barrier
Consider again the reaction
A + C - B → A - B + C
During a course of collision, new bond A - B develops. At the same time bond C - B breaks. A configuration in which all the three atoms are weakly connected together is called activated complex.
A + B - C → [A···B···C] → A - B + C
To attain the configuration A ··· B ··· C atoms need to gain energy, which comes from the kinetic energy of colliding molecules.
The energy barrier between reactants and products is shown in Fig. 6.7. The reactant molecules need to climb up and overcome this before they get converted to products. The height of the barrier is called activation energy (Eₐ). Thus the reactant molecules transform to products only if they possess energy equal to or greater than such activation energy. A fraction of molecules those possess energy greater than Eₐ is given by f = e⁻ᴱᵃ/ᴿᵀ.

***

**Fig. 6.7: Potential energy barrier**

*   A graph of Energy vs. Reaction coordinate. Reactants start at a certain energy level. The energy increases, peaking at the transition state (labeled Eₐ, activation energy), and then decreases to the product's energy level. The difference in energy between reactants and products is labeled ΔH.

***

As a result only a few collisions lead to products. The number of successful collisions are further reduced by the orientation requirement already discussed.

***

**Do you know ?**
For a gaseous reaction at 298 K, Eₐ = 75 kJ/mol. The fraction of successful collisions is given by f = e⁻ᴱᵃ/ᴿᵀ = e⁻⁷⁵⁰⁰⁰/(⁸.³¹⁴ × ²⁹⁸) = 7 × 10⁻¹⁸ or only 7 collisions in 10¹⁸ collisions are sufficiently energetic to lead to the reaction.

***

**Remember...**
All collisions of reactant molecules do not lead to a chemical reaction. The colliding molecules need to possess certain energy which is greater than the activation energy Eₐ and proper orientation.

***

### 6.7 Temperature dependence of reaction rates

**Do you know ?**
It has been observed that the rates of most of the chemical reactions usually increase with temperature. In everyday life we see that the fuels such as oil, coal are inert at room temperature but burn rapidly at higher temperatures. Many foods spoil rapidly at room temperature and lasts longer in freezer.

The concentrations change only a little with temperature. The rate constant shows a strong dependence on the temperature.

#### 6.7.1 Arrhenius equation
Arrhenius suggested that the rate of a reaction varies with temperature as
k = A e⁻ᴱᵃ/ᴿᵀ .................... 6.18
where k is the rate constant, Eₐ is the activation energy, R molar gas constant, T temperature in kelvin, and A is the pre-exponential factor. Eq. (6.18) is called as the Arrhenius equation.
The pre exponential factor A and the rate constant have same unit in case of the first order reactions. Besides A is found to be related to frequency of collisions.

#### 6.7.2 Graphical determination of activation energy
Taking logarithm of both sides of eqn (6.18) we obtain
ln k = -Eₐ/RT + ln A .................... (6.19)
Converting natural base to base 10 we write
log₁₀ k = (-Eₐ / 2.303 R) (1/T) + log₁₀ A .................... (6.20)
y = m x + c
This equation is of the form of straight line y = mx + c.
The Arrhenius plot of log₁₀ k versus 1/T giving a straight line is shown in Fig. (6.8). A slope of the line is -Eₐ /2.303R with its intercept being log₁₀ A.

***

**Fig. 6.8 : Variation of log₁₀k with 1/T**

*   A graph of log₁₀ k vs. 1/T. The y-axis is labeled log₁₀ k and the x-axis is 1/T. A straight line with a negative slope is shown.

***

From a slope of the line the activation energy can be determined. Eq. (6.18) shows that with an increase of temperature, -Eₐ/RT and in turn, the rate of reaction would increase.

#### 6.7.3 Determination of activation energy
For two different temperatures T₁ and T₂
log₁₀ k₁ = log₁₀A - Eₐ / 2.303 RT₁ .................... (6.21)
log₁₀ k₂ = log₁₀A - Eₐ / 2.303 RT₂ .................... (6.22)
where k₁ and k₂ are the rate constants at temperatures T₁ and T₂ respectively. Subtracting Eq. (6.21) from Eq. (6.22),
log₁₀k₂ - log₁₀ k₁ = - Eₐ / 2.303 R T₂ + Eₐ / 2.303 R T₁

***

Hence, log₁₀(k₂/k₁) = (Eₐ / 2.303 R) (1/T₁ - 1/T₂)
= (Eₐ / 2.303 R) ((T₂ - T₁) / T₁T₂) .................... (6.23)

#### 6.7.4 Graphical description of effect of temperature
It has been realized that average kinetic energy of molecules is proportional to temperature. The collision theory suggested a bimolecular reaction occurs only if the reacting molecules have sufficient kinetic energies (at least Eₐ) and proper orientation when they collide.
At a given temperature, the fraction of molecules with their kinetic energy equal to or greater than Eₐ may lead to the product. With an increase of temperature the fraction of molecules having their energies equal to or greater than (≥ Eₐ) would increases. The rate of the reaction thus would increase. This is depicted by plotting a fraction of molecules with given kinetic energy versus kinetic energy for two different temperatures T₁ and T₂ (T₂ being > T₁) in Fig. 6.9.

***

**Fig. 6.9 : Comparison of fraction of molecules activated at T₁ and T₂**

*   A graph of "Fraction of molecules with given kinetic energy" vs. "Kinetic Energy". Two distribution curves are shown, one for T₁ and a broader one for T₂ (where T₂ > T₁). A vertical line indicates the activation energy (Eₐ). The shaded area to the right of this line is larger for T₂, showing a greater fraction of molecules have sufficient energy to react at the higher temperature.

***

The area under the curve is proportional to number of molecules with those values of kinetic energy. The total area is the same at T₁ and T₂. The areas (a) and (b) represent the fraction of molecules with kinetic energy exceeding Eₐ at T₁ and T₂ respectively (since T₂ > T₁). This indicates that a fraction of molecules possessing energies larger than Eₐ increase with temperature. The rate of reaction increases accordingly.

***

**Problem 6.12:** The rate constants for a first order reaction are 0.6 s⁻¹ at 313 K and 0.045 s⁻¹ at 293 K. What is the activation energy?
**Solution**
log₁₀(k₂/k₁) = (Eₐ / 2.303 R) ((T₂ - T₁) / T₁T₂)
k₁ = 0.045 s⁻¹, k₂ = 0.6 s⁻¹, T₁ = 293 K, T₂ = 313 K, R = 8.314 J K⁻¹mol⁻¹
Substituting
log₁₀ (0.6 / 0.045) = (Eₐ / (2.303 × 8.314)) × [(313 – 293) / (293 × 313)]
log₁₀ 13.33 = (Eₐ / (2.303 × 8.314)) × [20 / (293 × 313)]
1.1248 = (Eₐ / 19.15) × 2.18 × 10⁻⁴
Eₐ = 1.1248 × 19.15 J mol⁻¹ / 2.18 × 10⁻⁴
= 98810 J/mol⁻¹ = 98.8 kJ/mol⁻¹

***

**Problem 6.13:** A first order gas phase reaction has activation energy of 240 kJ mol⁻¹. If the pre-exponential factor is 1.6 × 10¹³ s⁻¹, what is the rate constant of the reaction at 600 K?
**Solution :** Arrhenius equation
k = A e⁻ᴱᵃ/ᴿᵀ is written as
log₁₀(A/k) = Eₐ / 2.303 RT
Eₐ = 240 kJ mol⁻¹ = 240 × 10³ J mol⁻¹,
T = 600 K, A = 1.6 × 10¹³ s⁻¹
Hence log₁₀ (A/k) = (240 × 10³ J mol⁻¹) / (2.303 × 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹× 600 K)
= 20.89
contd....

***

A/k = antilog 20.89 = 7.78 × 10²⁰
and k = A / (7.78 × 10²⁰) = (1.6 × 10¹³ s⁻¹) / (7.78 × 10²⁰)
= 2.055 × 10⁻⁸ s⁻¹

***

**Problem 6.14:** The half life of a first order reaction is 900 min at 820 K. Estimate its half life at 720 K if the activation energy is 250 kJ mol⁻¹.
**Solution :**
t₁/₂ = 0.693 / k
Rate constants at two different temperatures, T₁ and T₂ are k₁ and k₂ respectively, and the corresponding half lives (t₁/₂)₁ and (t₁/₂)₂.
(t₁/₂)₁ = 0.693 / k₁ and (t₁/₂)₂ = 0.693 / k₂
Hence, (t₁/₂)₁ / (t₁/₂)₂ = k₂ / k₁
The equation, log₁₀(k₂/k₁) = (Eₐ / 2.303 R) × [(T₂ - T₁) / T₁T₂]
log₁₀((t₁/₂)₁ / (t₁/₂)₂) = (Eₐ / 2.303 R) × [(T₂ - T₁) / T₁T₂]
Eₐ = 250 kJ mol⁻¹, T₁ = 720 K, T₂ = 820 K, (t₁/₂)₂ = 900 min
Thus, log₁₀((t₁/₂)₁ / 900) = (250 × 10³ J mol⁻¹) / (2.303 × 8.314 J K⁻¹mol⁻¹) × [(820 K – 720 K) / (820 K × 720 K)]
= 2.212
(t₁/₂)₁ / 900 = antilog 2.212 = 162.7
(t₁/₂)₁ = 900 × 162.7 = 1.464 × 10⁵ min

### 6.8 Effect of a catalyst on the rate of reaction
A catalyst is a substance added to the reactants that increases the rate of the reaction without itself being consumed in the reaction.
Consider
2 KClO₃(s) --MnO₂--> 2 KCl(s) + 3O₂(g)
Here MnO₂ is the catalyst. It has been observed that the decomposition rate increases with the addition of catalyst. A catalyst provides alternative pathway associated with lower activation energy.
Fig. 6.10 compares the potential energy barriers for the catalysed and uncatalysed reactions. The barrier for uncatalysed reaction (Eₐ)₁ is larger than that for the same reaction in the presence of a catalyst (Eₐ)₂.

***

**Fig. 6.10 : Potential energy barriers for catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions**

*   A graph of Energy vs. reaction coordinate. Two pathways from reactants to products are shown. The higher-energy pathway is labeled (Eₐ)₁ for the uncatalyzed reaction. The lower-energy pathway is labeled (Eₐ)₂ for the catalyzed reaction. Both start at the same reactant energy and end at the same product energy.

***

Consider the decomposition of H₂O₂ in aqueous solution catalysed by I⁻ ions.
2H₂O₂(l) --I⁻--> 2 H₂O(l) + O₂(g)
At room temperature the rate of reaction is slower in the absence of catalyst with its activation energy being 76 kJ mol⁻¹. In the presence of iodide ion catalyst I⁻ the reaction is faster since the activation energy decreases to 57 kJ mol⁻¹.

***

**Fig. 6.11 : Comparison of fraction of molecules for catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions**

*   A graph showing the fraction of molecules (dN/N) versus Energy. A distribution curve is shown. Two vertical lines indicate two different activation energies. The higher energy, (Eₐ)₁, is labeled "Before use of catalyst". The lower energy, (Eₐ)₂, is labeled "in the presence of catalyst". The shaded area to the right of (Eₐ)₂ is larger than the area to the right of (Eₐ)₁, indicating more molecules can react when a catalyst is present.

***

Fig 6.11 shows a plot of fraction of molecules as a function of energy. A catalyst lowers the threshold energy. Consequently more molecules acquire the minimum amount of energy and tend to cross the energy barrier. A fraction of activated molecules is greater for the catalyzed reaction. The rate of catalyzed reaction thus is larger than the reaction with no catalyst.

***
